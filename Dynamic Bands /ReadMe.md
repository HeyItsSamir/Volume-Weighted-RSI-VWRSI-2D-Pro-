## 📊 Dynamic Bands Overview

VWRSI 2D Pro includes shaded dynamic bands to highlight volume-weighted exhaustion zones:

- **Overbought Zone**: 70–100 (shaded red)
- **Oversold Zone**: 0–30 (shaded green)
- **Midline**: 50 (gray) — acts as a trend filter

These bands are not static—they reflect volume-adjusted momentum extremes. When RSI enters these zones with strong volume, it signals potential reversal or exhaustion.


### 🔍 Best Practices

- Use the 50 midline to confirm trend bias:
  - RSI > 50 → bullish setups
  - RSI < 50 → bearish setups
- Combine band crossovers with RSI MA for entry/exit signals
- Watch for divergences near band edges for early reversal clues
